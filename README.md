# SFML_Chess
Chess implemented in C++ using SFML. My first Coding project ever; it is unfinished. Pawns only promote to queens, but it is a fully functional chess game otherwise.
An "Engine" plays moves against you using a recursive search function with a depth of 3-4 to select moves. The engine has an estimated elo of 400-600 (it's pretty easy to beat if you know a thing or two about chess).
